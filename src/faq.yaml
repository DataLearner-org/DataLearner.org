- question: |-
    What if our server fails to consume the webhook? When will they be fired
    again, and are they idempotent?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    For timeouts and 5xx errors, we retry three times with a one-second delay
    between each retry.

- question: Is it possible to get the total running time of a session from the meeting.ended webhook?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    We send `startedAt` and `endedAt` timestamps in a `meeting.ended` webhook
    that can be used to compute the session's running time.

- question: What is the expected delay in the livestream, and what happens if it exceeds the expected delay?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Typically, there is a 3-5 second lag in all livestreams. If the delay exceeds 10 seconds, users can "Skip to Live," which involves dropping frames in order to synchronize the user's video with the live stream. Once the videos are synced, we stop dropping frames until the time exceeds 10 seconds again.

- question: What is the maximum number of hosts and viewers allowed to participate in a livestream?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Dyte's Interactive Livestreaming (ILS) can currently accommodate 10,000 viewers and 100 hosts on a single livestream.

- question: What is the maximum number of users that the livestream can handle, and how does this impact its quality?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Currently, our platform can support up to 10,000 viewers in a single livestream, and the quality of the stream is not affected by the number of viewers. However, an increase in the number of users may impact other features such as chats and polls.

- question: How do I manage viewer permissions for a livestream?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: You can manage the permissions for a viewer using presets. For livestreaming, you must create two presets. One preset is for the livestreaming host, while the other is for the livestreaming viewer. For details, see Create [Presets](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/livestream/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets).

- question: Can I join the livestream as a host in the middle of the livestream?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Yes, you can. However, ensure that you've the required preset permissions. For details, see Create [Presets](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/livestream/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets).

- question: What permissions does a host require to start a livestream?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: The host requires certain host controls such as the ability to Kick Participants, Mute Audio, Mute Video, and Pin Participant, as well as media permissions like Start Livestream and Admit or remove participants from the livestream. For details, see Create [Presets](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/livestream/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets).

- question: How much latency can be expected with Dyte's live streams?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: Dyte provides live streams with a low latency of only 3 to 6 seconds.

- question: Is it necessary to generate new stream keys for each live event?
  tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']
  answer: |-
    No, stream keys can be reused multiple times. However, it's important to keep the stream key private as it grants access to the live stream. Therefore, users should be informed to keep their stream key secure.

    For more information, see [Livestreaming any Video via RTMP](https://docs.dyte.io/guides/livestream/livestream-any-rtmp).

- question: |-
    I'm encountering audio and video problems while developing a live video
    solution for my app. I'm using Chrome to test the microphone and camera.
    What could be causing this?
  tags: ['Technical']
  answer: |-
    The issue could be due to the security features implemented by the
    browser. Most of the standard browsers with best security practices restrict
    many features to HTTPS instead of HTTP. You can read about the details of
    the features that are restricted in Chrome
    [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins).


    To troubleshoot, we recommend trying the steps mentioned in this
    [document](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/). If this does not
    resolve the issue, you can try using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as an
    alternative solution.


    To use ngrok, download the software and run it with the local port
    specified. This generates an HTTPS URL that you can use for testing the
    microphone and camera.

    1. Download ngrok.

    2. Run the command 'ngrok http PUT_LOCAL_PORT_HERE'.

    3. Use the HTTPS URL to test your microphone and camera.
